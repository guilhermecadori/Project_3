    A square of squares

    You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
    And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

    However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with 
    an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're 
    currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of 
    building blocks is a perfect square.
    
    Task
    Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
        In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an 
        integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
    
    The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
        Examples
            -1  =>  false
            0  =>  true
            3  =>  false
            4  =>  true
            25  =>  true
            26  =>  false
